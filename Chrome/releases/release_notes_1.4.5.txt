* Changed permission from activeTab to optional_host_permissions to avoid silent disabling.
* New Welcome Experience: Introduced a dedicated onboarding/upboarding page to guide users through new features and privacy settings.
* Customizable Toolbar Actions: Configure the toolbar icon for a Dropdown menu (default), immediate Search, or immediate Archive via Options.
* Fixed Extension Removal: Restored the "Remove" button functionality in both Options and Welcome pages to correctly uninstall the extension.
