Adds a button to the Microsoft Edge toolbar. When clicked, it sends the URL of the current tab to Archive Today <https://archive.today> to preserve a snapshot of the page, and opens the result in a new tab.
Also includes Link context menu to Archive or Search, Page context menu to Search. 
Archive URL can be bookmarked for future reference, shared, whatever. Uses HTTPS for security.
For similar functionality on Android, check out Share2Archive in the Play Store.

NOTES:
1. You may need to click the Save button after the archive website has opened to start the archiving process.
2. If you get an error, try again or try later. It's NOT an extension issueâ€”Archive Today sometimes gets overwhelmed.
3. CloudFlare DNS may not resolve Archive Today, so if you experience DNS errors, try a different DNS service.

(Archive Today is a time capsule for web pages. It takes a 'snapshot' of a webpage that will always be online even if the original page disappears. It saves a text and a graphical copy of the page for better accuracy and provides a short and reliable link to an unalterable record of the web page.)
