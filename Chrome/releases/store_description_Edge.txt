(Archive Today is a time capsule for web pages. It takes a 'snapshot' of a webpage that will always be online even if the original page disappears. It saves a text and a graphical copy of the page for better accuracy and provides a short and reliable link to an unalterable record of the web page.)

Consent:
By using this extension, you consent to sharing your Archive or Search URL with Archive Today when initiated by you. This extension does not otherwise collect or share any user data.

Notes:
1. You may need to click the Save button after the archive website has opened to start the archiving process.
2. If you get an error, try again later. It's NOT an extension issue—Archive Today sometimes gets overwhelmed.
3. CloudFlare DNS may not resolve Archive Today; if you experience DNS errors, try a different DNS server.
4. For similar functionality on Android, check out app Share2Archive in the Play Store.
