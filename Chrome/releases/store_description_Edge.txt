NEW: Customizable Toolbar Button
Choose your preferred action for the toolbar icon:
• Dropdown Menu: Quick access to Search, Archive, and Options.
• Direct Search: Instantly search the current page URL.
• Direct Archive: Instantly archive the current page.

Features:
• Archive Today Integration: Sends the current tab URL to Archive Today to preserve a snapshot and opens the result in a new tab.
• Context Menus: Includes Link context menus to Archive or Search. A Page context menu to Search is available when the toolbar is set to "Archive (only)".
• Customizable Behavior: Options to control if the new tab opens adjacent to the current tab, at the end of the tab strip, or replaces the current tab (archive only).
• Tab Activation: Control whether new Archive or Search tabs are activated immediately.
• HTTPS Security: Uses HTTPS for all archival and search transmissions.
• Keyboard Shortcuts: A custom shortcut can be created to archive the current page instantly.

(Archive Today is a time capsule for web pages. It takes a 'snapshot' of a webpage that will always be online even if the original page disappears. It saves a text and a graphical copy of the page for better accuracy and provides a short and reliable link to an unalterable record of the web page.)

Consent:
By using this extension, you consent to sharing your Archive or Search URL with Archive Today when initiated by you. This extension does not otherwise collect or share any user data.

Notes:
1. If you get an error, try again later. It's NOT an extension issue—Archive Today sometimes gets overwhelmed.
2. CloudFlare DNS may not resolve Archive Today; if you experience DNS errors, try a different DNS server.
3. For similar functionality on Android, check out app Share2Archive in the Play Store.
