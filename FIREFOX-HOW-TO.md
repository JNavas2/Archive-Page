# Firefox sideloading of Archive Page extension
1. In Firefox, click on [this link](https://github.com/JNavas2/Archive-Page/raw/refs/heads/main/Firefox/releases/Archive-Page-Firefox-unlisted-1.2.1.xpi).
2. 
3. Open `about:addons` in Firefox.
4. Click the _Tools gearwheel_ at top right, then `Install Add-on From File`.

(Mozilla removed Archive Page from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) due to alleged policy violations (that make no sense),
rejecting several major attempts to resolve the issue, so Archive Page no longer supports Firefox Add-ons, but (at least for now) it can be _sideloaded_ instead.)
