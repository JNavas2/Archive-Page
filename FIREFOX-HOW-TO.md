## Firefox sideloading of Archive Page extension
1. In Firefox, right-click on [this link](https://github.com/JNavas2/Archive-Page/raw/refs/heads/main/Firefox/releases/Archive-Page-Firefox-unlisted-1.2.1.xpi), then 'Save Link Asâ€¦' to save the XPI file to your computer. Make a note of where it is saved.
2. Open _Manage extensions_ (`about:addons`) in Firefox.
3. Click the _Tools gearwheel_ at top right, then `Install Add-on From File`.
4. Select your saved XPI file, then click `Add`.
 
Mozilla removed Archive Page from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) due to alleged policy violations (that make no sense),
rejecting several major attempts to resolve the issue, so Archive Page no longer supports Firefox Add-ons, but (at least for now) it can be _sideloaded_ instead.
