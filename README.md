Available for **[Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/archive-page/gcaimhkfmliahedmeklebabdgagipbia?hl=en-US)**, **[Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/archive-page/llldbgankiiaiobhnjpbllpijlidinaf)** and **[Mozille Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/archive-page/)**.
2. You may need to click the **Save** button after the archive website has opened to start the archiving process.
3. If you get an error, try again or try later. It's _not_ an extension issueâ€”archive.today sometimes gets overwhelmed.
4. CloudFlare DNS may not resolve archive.today, so if you experience DNS errors, try a different [DNS service](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-dns-server).
