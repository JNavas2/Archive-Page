  Create a shortcut to archive the current page even faster.

- **Tracking** can be removed from URLs with the **[ClearURLs extension](https://github.com/ClearURLs)** (good but not perfect) and is **strongly recommended**:

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Archiving Process:**  
  You may need to click the **Save** button on archive.today after the page loads to begin archiving.

- **Error Handling:**  
  If you encounter an error, simply try again later. Archive.today may be temporarily overwhelmed; this is *not* an extension issue.

- **DNS Issues:**  
  If you experience DNS errors, try a different DNS service (e.g., [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net)) or VPN.
