* Privacy Policy of Archive Today (as of this writing): Source IP is not disclosed, but "take in mind that when you archive a page, your IP is being sent to the the website you archive as though you are using a proxy (in X-Forwarded-For header).

It saves a text and a graphical copy of the page for better accuracy and provides a short and reliable link to an unalterable record of the web page.)
