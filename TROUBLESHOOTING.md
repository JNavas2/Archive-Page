**CONNECTION PROBLEMS**
When you have trouble connecting to Archive Today, the likely cause is blocking by your Internet service.   
Possible work-arounds:
1. Try a **different Internet service**.
2. Try a **different DNS resolver**, e.g., Quad9
3. Try VPN, e.g., Surfshark   
4. Try an alias of Archive Today.<br/>The extension now supports selecting an alias like archive.is, but Firefox is not supported. Mozilla keeps rejecting updates due to alleged policy violations and is threatening to remove the extension altogether (tomorrow). Thus, to use the extension you would have to switch browsers. An option for Firefox would be to use the bookmarklet and edit it to the alias of your choice, but only toolbar icon, not context menu.
